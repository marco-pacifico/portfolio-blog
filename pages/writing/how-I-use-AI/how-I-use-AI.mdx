It’s hard to think about 2023 without thinking about AI. So as a sort of year in review, I thought I’d go back and document the ways I’ve used AI over the last twelve months.

## What I mean by AI
When I say AI, I’m talking about text-based, generative AI powered by large language models like GPT-4. 

There are the chat assistants: ChatGPT by OpenAI, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Bard are the ones I’ve used.

And then there are tools that use a model’s API to power certain features. Top of mind for me are:

- **Github’s Copilot** for suggesting and autocompleting code
- **Notion** as a writing assitant 
- **Otter.ai** as a transcription service
- **Framer** to generate landing page designs and copy
- **Figma’s FigJam** to organize sticky notes and tempalates

I’ve tried a bunch of tools and features powered by large language models, but aside from Coplilot, I haven’t used them nearly as much as the chat-based assistants.

I feel like **90% plus of my use of AI has been through ChatGPT’s chat interface and Copilot’s autocomplete in VS Code.**

As an aside, it’s interesting that chat and autocomplete in a text editor are the two interfaces that have had the most traction with me, probably because they go with the grain of the underlying technology. Many tools take more of a "right click to do something using AI" approach that feels bolted on and not seamlessly integrated into a workflow. Obviously we’re still in the early days, so I’m curious to see AI-powered features and interfaces evolve. 

So with that out of the way, below are the top ways I’ve been using AI in 2023. 

## Teacher
One of the use cases I’ve valued most is asking chat-based AI assistants to explain concepts and code syntax. 

In 2023 I learned more about code and spent more time coding than any year before. It would have been much harder to learn what I did without help from AI. I definitely would have spent a lot more time feeling stuck and frustrated. 

Looking back at my chat history in ChatGPT and Claude, here are some examples of things I’ve asked to have explained:

- *Explain the following code line by line [code]*
- *What does the `zip` do in `for x, y in zip(sizes[:-1], sizes[1:])`?*
- *Can you explain the math behind gradient descent?*
- *What are the main concepts of TypeScript?*

I’d often ask follow up questions to clarify things I didn’t understand.
- *Can you explain [this sentence, syntax, or line of code] further?*
- *What does the `??` syntax do?*
- *Why did you define an interface rather than a type?*

I’d even challenge an explination when I thought it was wrong.
- *I’ve been doing it this way and it seems to work. Why did you suggest this other way?*
- *I’m trying this code and it’s doing the opposite of what you’re saying it should do. Why is that?*

The thing is sometimes it actually is 100% wrong and sometimes it’s only sort of right. So you have to have some base knowledge and ways of validating what it says to use it effectively. 


## Collaborator
Another valuable use case has been asking or talking through how to approach a problem or how to fix an issue. 

For example, I asked ChatGPT, *"How might I create a table of contents component in React that links to headlines within an article written in markdown?"* and it sketched how to do it step by step. I still had to write most of the code and figure out a bunch of issues on my own, but this gave me a starting point and map to follow. 

Here's another example. I asked Claude, *"I'm using styled components and my css changes depending on the value of the props I pass in. [sample of my code] What are some ways to avoid all this prop drilling?"* 

In this case I didn't use any of the approaches it suggested, but I had a conversation with it discussing the issues with each appraoch, and that helped me think through the problem and come up with my own solution.

In cases like this, it's been cool ask *"what about this approach instead?"* and get feedback on whether it's a good idea or not.

When it comes to fixing issues, I've either pasted in my code and asked why the code isn't doing what I'm expecting it to do. Or I've pasted in an error message and asked, *"How would you fix this error?"* or *"What does this error mean?"* or *"What's causing this error?"* 

## Data Convertor 
Take data in one format and convert it to another.
Unstructured to structured. Structured to unstructured.
Bullet points to a paragraph. Paragraph to bullet points.

What I mean is translating between different data formats. Turn a CSV into a JSON, or a JSON into a YAML. Turn HSL into RGB, or RGB into HEX. 

- *I have a json object and I need it reformatted. This the original format: ... and I’d like it in this format: ...*

Remove the quotation marks from this text. '--color-primary-100': 'hsl(240deg 100% 90%)',

Extract a date from a string

## Automator

Writing simple scripts to automate tasks is another common use case for me.

REgex to find and replace text.
Reformatting text, or converting between different data formats.

Writing a script to create the boilerplate for a new blog post. 


## Copy Editor 
Help me write better. Grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and word choice. Clumbsy or clunky construction. 

I’ll ask, how would you interpret what I wrote to see if what I’m trying to say is clear.
- *How would you interpret this sentence?*
- *How could I improve this text for clarity and concision?*

Alternative phrases for a word or phrase I’m using.

Write this in the style of William Zinsser or Strunk and White or Amazon’s writing style guide.

Getting correct terminology for a concept or word or thing I’m trying to describe. E.g What's another word for folder in the context of a code repository?


## Summarizer
Put in a long article or PDF and get a summary of the key points. Then ask follow up queustions. I did this with Atwul Gawande’s New Yorker article on coaching. I want to do with with annual reports but haven’t done that yet. 

Can you summarize the key takeaways as it relates to coaching. I don't want to know about his personal history or anecdotes -- just the actionable insights and takeaways
Sumarizing documentation is another common use case for me.

## Researcher
I’ve used AI to help me research topics. I’ll ask it to find articles on a topic and then summarize the key points.

What arguments can the "googlefinance" function take in google sheets?

What questions should I ask when offered stock options as part of an employment offer?

Let's dive deeper on Newsletter Software. What options exist? How would you evaluate each option?

What are some small beachside towns in Italy where I could go on vacation?

## Auto-completer 
Obviously Copilot is great for this and the main benefit is speeding up my workflow by reducing the amount of typing I have to do and not having to look up syntax.

I’ve discoverd Copilot also works for writing, since I write my blog posts in markdown in the VS Code editor. 

Rarely ever do I keep the exact words Copilot suggests, but it’s a great way to get ideas, play with different ways of saying things, and to get unstuck. It also helps me identify what I don’t want to say, which is just as important as what I do want to say.

## What it’s not good at
Writing articles based on bullet points or outlines. I’ve tried this a few times and it’s not good.

## Going forward
I want to integrate AI into my workflow by using the APIs to build tools that help me do my work.
