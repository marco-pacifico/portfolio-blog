As 2023 comes to a close and I reflect back on the year, it's hard not to think about how much AI has changed things.

So I thought I'd write a sort of year in review documenting the ways I've used AI over the last twelve months.

## What I mean by AI
When I say AI, I'm talking about generative AI, specifically the chat-based assistants powered by large language models like GPT-4. 

There's ChatGPT by OpenAI, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Bard, and a few others.

Then there are tools that use OpenAI's APIs to power certain features. Top of mind for me are:
- Github's Copilot for suggesting and autocompleting code
- Notion as a writing assitant 
- Otter.ai as a transcription service
- Framer to generate landing page designs and copy
- Figma's FigJam to organize sticky notes and tempalates

While I'm aware of the many tools and features powered by large language models, I don't use them as much as the chat-based assistants.

To be honest, I'd say **90% plus of my use of AI is through ChatGPT's chat interface and Copilot's autocomplete in VS Code.**

So with that out of the way, below are the top ways I've been using AI in 2023.

## Tutor
By far the most common way I use AI is to learn new things and to get help undestanding concepts, or syntax. 

## Collaborator
Brainstorming how to solve a problem, or how to approach a project is another common use case for me.

## Universal translator 
I'm not talking about translating between spoken languages, though I'm sure people use it for that. 

What I mean is translating between different data formats. Turn a CSV into a JSON, or a JSON into a YAML. Turn HSL into RGB, or RGB into HEX. 

## Automator
Writing simple scripts to automate tasks is another common use case for me.

## Editor 
Help me write better. Grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and word choice. Clumbsy or clunky construction. 

## Auto-completer 
Obviously Copilot is great for this and the main benefit is speeding up my workflow by reducing the amount of typing I have to do and not having to look up syntax.

I've discoverd Copilot also works for writing, since I write my blog posts in markdown in the VS Code editor. 

Rarely ever do I keep the exact words Copilot suggests, but it's a great way to get ideas, play with different ways of saying things, and to get unstuck. It also helps me identify what I don't want to say, which is just as important as what I do want to say.

## Summarizer
Put in a long article or PDF and get a summary of the key points. Then ask follow up queustions. I did this with Atwul Gawande's New Yorker article on coaching. I want to do with with annual reports but haven't done that yet. 

## Going forward
I want to integrate AI into my workflow by using the APIs to build tools that help me do my work.
