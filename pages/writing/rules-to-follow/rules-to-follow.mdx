Generally I’m not big on rules, but here are the ones I strive follow:

## 01
Be honest, with yourself and with others. We live in glasshouses, so what’s the point in lying? And if you lie to yourself, you’re just prolonging the inevitable. You know what that is.

## 02
Write everything down. When creativity strikes, you have to capture it. Do it. Right now. In the middle of the night. At the gym. Wherever.

## 03
Challenge assumptions. Ask questions. Constantly. Of everybody and everything.

## 04
Have a reason for everything. If you’re going to do something, make sure you know why. There’s no point in drifting.

## 05
Sleep. I use this as a metaphor for being smart about how we operate. If we don’t sleep, there might be more time to do things, but it’s likely that less will get done.

## 06
Do things differently. How else are you going to change the world? Or even change your own life?

## 07
Do what’s difficult. Most things worth doing are hard to do. And if you’re avoiding something just because of fear, it’s probably *the* thing you should be doing.

## 08
Appreciate the good and learn from the bad: a) Take nothing for granted b) Everything happens for a reason, whether you know it or not. Just make sure you eventually figure out what those reasons are.

## 09
Create things of lasting value. Add value to the world in your own unique way and then share it.

## 10
Do what you love. It might be elusive, but I think the noblest thing a person can do is pursue what they’re passionate about. Work towards it everyday.

## 11
Make your own rules. Seriously, do what you have to do. Who says you have to color between the lines? Why not make your own lines?
