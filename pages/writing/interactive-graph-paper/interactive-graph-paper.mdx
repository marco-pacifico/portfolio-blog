## Why make this?

Recently I came across a [landing page](https://vaul.emilkowal.ski/) by [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski/). The hero section has subtle gridlines that gradually fade out. I really like how this grid pattern gives a sense of technical precision and engineering.

Whenever I see a website using a grid like this, I'm alway curious to learn how it was implemented.

There are so many variations. You can do a square grid, a dot grid, or a double grid (also called "engineering paper"). You even can create guidelines that align to content on the page.

<div style={{display: "flex"}}>
 
  <div style={{position: "relative", height: 200, width: "33%", margin: "40px 0 24px 0"}}>
  <GraphPaper 
    glowOpacity={0} 
    decorationOpacity={0} 
    maskCoverage={1000}
    horizontalLines={true}
    />  
  </div>
   <div style={{position: "relative", height: 200, width: "33%", margin: "40px 0 24px 0"}}>
  <GraphPaper 
    glowOpacity={0} 
    decorationOpacity={0} 
    maskCoverage={1000}
    verticalLines={false}
    dots={true}
    />  
  </div>
  <div style={{position: "relative", height: 200, width: "33%", margin: "40px 0 24px 0"}}>
  <GraphPaper 
    glowOpacity={0} 
    decorationOpacity={0} 
    maskCoverage={1000}
    horizontalLines={true}
    innerGrid={true}
    />  
  </div>
</div>

I made this interactive grid because it felt like a fun way to learn how to create these various patterns and also to practice my React skills, especially what I've learned about [state and controlled inputs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input#controlling-an-input-with-a-state-variable).

I was inspired by [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com) who writes [interactive blog posts](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) and makes tools like this [CSS Shadow Palette Generator](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/shadow-palette/). I also learned React mostly from Josh's course, [The Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com/), which I highly recommend.

## Repeating shapes

To create a grid pattern you draw a shape in a small bit of space. Then you repeat it across the width and height of a parent container.

To create gridlines, you can draw and repeat a line or a backwards L shape.
 <div style={{position: "relative", height: 100, width: 100, margin: "40px 0 24px 0"}}>
  <GraphPaper 
    glowOpacity={0} 
    decorationOpacity={0} 
    maskCoverage={1000}
    horizontalLines={true}
    cellSize={100}
    />  
  </div>

To create a dot grid, you can draw and repeat a small circle.

<div style={{display: "flex"}}>
  <div style={{position: "relative", height: 100, width: 100, margin: "40px 0 24px 0"}}>
  <GraphPaper 
    glowOpacity={0} 
    decorationOpacity={0} 
    maskCoverage={1000}
    verticalLines={false}
    dots={true}
    cellSize={100}
    />  
  </div>
 
 
</div>


## How to draw and repeat shapes

It turns out there are at least three ways to draw a shape and repeat it across the width and height of a parent container.

1. Background Image
2. CSS Grid
3. SVG Patterns

I ended up using SVG patterns to create the grid patterns for this interactive grid. 

If you're curious to know how each apprach works, I explain them in more detail in the sections below.

<div style={{margin:"var(--margin-paragraph)"}}>
<details>
<summary>Using a background image </summary>

In CSS, if you set a `background-image` on an element, the image will be repeated so it covers the entire element, giving a tiling effect. [[source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image)]

```css
.element {
  background-image: url("some-image.png");
}
/* some-image.png is tiled across the element */
```

By setting the `background-size` [property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-size), you can define the size of the image or tile that will be repeated. The smaller the tile, the denser the grid will be.

```css
.element {
  background-size: 200px 100px; 
}
/* Sets the width and height of the image or tile */
```

Instead of an image url, you can use the `linear-gradient()` function to create a line or the `radial-gradient()` function to create a small circle.

[Linear](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) and [radial gradients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/radial-gradient) are special kind of images that consist of *"a progressive transition between two or more colors."* 

The trick for creating a line or a dot is to make the outer color transparent and then place the color stops next to each other to create a sharp edge where one color transitions to the next color.

```css
/* Create a 1px wide vertical black line on the right edge 
of a 16px sqaure */

.element {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    to-left, /* direction of the gradient */
    black, /*  color starts at the right edge */
    black 1px, /* color ends after 1px */
    transparent 1px); /* transparency starts where color ends 
    and fills the rest of the image */

  background-size: 16px 16px; /* size of the image or tile */
}
```
Similarly, using radial gradient, you can create a circle with a sharp edge by making the outer color transparent and then placing the color stops next to each other.

```css
/* Create a cicle of radius --dot-size and color --dot-color, 
placed at the center of a --cell-size square */

background-image: radial-gradient(
    circle at center,
    var(--dot-color),
    var(--dot-color) var(--dot-size),
    transparent var(--grid-dot-size)
  );
background-size: var(--cell-size) var(--cell-size);
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>Using CSS grid </summary>

Let's say you want to make a square grid, first create a grid of `--num-rows` and `--num-columns` where each square in the grid is `--cell-size` wide and tall.

```css

```css
.grid {
  --num-rows: 10;
  --num-columns: 10;
  --cell-size: 100px;

  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(
    var(--num-columns),
    var(--cell-size));
  grid-template-rows: repeat(
    var(--num-rows),
    var(--cell-size));
}
```

Then place empty divs on the grid and apply a right and bottom border to create a backwards L shape.
  
```css
/* Grid child elements */
.cell-1-1 {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-row-start: 1;
  border-right: 1px solid black;
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}
.cell-1-2 {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-row-start: 2;
  border-right: 1px solid black;
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
}
/* Repeat for each cell in the grid */
...
```

**One challenge with this approach** is you need NxN empty divs to apply the border to. If the number of columns or rows changes, then number of empty divs has to change too.

**Another challenge** is that the `--cell-size` has to divide evenly into the width and height of the grid. Otherwise, the grid will be misaligned.

So as the grid shrinks and grows with the viewport, it will break unless you dynamically update the number of rows and columns and the cell size, using a combination of media queries and css custom properties.

**The benefit of this approach** is the precision and flexibility it gives you. You can mix dense gridlines with widely spaced gridlines and you can create cutouts in the grid. Also, you can actaully align content with the lines, since you can define the same grid for both the content and the gridlines.

Examples of where this appraoch is used are [stripesessions.com](https://stripesessions.com/) and [vercel.com/ai](https://vercel.com/ai).

<summary>Using SVG patterns </summary>

This approach is similar to background images, except the parent container is an SVG `<rect>` element and the bit of space that gets repeated is a `<pattern>` element.

Here's how it works:

SVG has a `<defs>` element that can contain reusable definitions. One of the things you can define is a `<pattern>` element. Then you can reference the `<pattern>` element by passing its `id` attribute to the `fill` attribute on an the `<rect>` element. 

```html
<svg>
  <defs>
    <pattern id="grid" width="10" height="10" patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
      /* draw a shape here */
    </pattern>
  </defs>
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#grid)" />
</svg>
```

Notice that `<pattern>` has a `width` and `height` attribute that define the size of the shape you want to repeat. This is similar to the `background-size` property in that it determines the density of the grid.

Another important attribute on the `<pattern>` element is `patternUnits="userSpaceOnUse"`. This ensures that the width and height of the pattern won't scale up or down as size of the parent container changes. In the code above, the width and height of the pattern will be 10px x 10px, no matter how big or small the parent container is.

Inside the `<pattern>` element, you draw a shape using SVG shape elements: 
- `<line>` element to create a line or a backwards L shape. 
- `<circle>` element to create a dot.  
- `<path>` element to create a square or any other shape you can imagine.
- Other shapes you can use are `<rect>`, `<ellipse>`, `<polygon>`, `<polyline>`, `<text>` and more.
- You can even nest a `<pattern>` element inside another `<pattern>` element.

If you want to learn more about drawing shapes using SVG paths, [Nanda Syahrasyad](https://www.nan.fyi) has a super cool interactive post, [A Deep Dive Into SVG Path Commands](https://www.nan.fyi/svg-paths). To learn about SVG more generally, W3Schools has a [comprehensive tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp).

## Layering patterns

To create the grid, I'm layering patterns so that each one can be toggled on and off to create different pattern combinations.

```jsx
function GridPattern() {
  return (
      <GridPatternWrapper>
        <VerticalLines />
        <HorizontalLines />
        <InnerGrid />
        <Dots />
      </GridPatternWrapper>
  );
}
```

Each pattern is component that renders a `<rect>` element that's filled by a `<pattern>`. The `<rect>` element spans the width and height of the parent container. 

For example, here's the component that renders the vertical lines:

```jsx
function VerticalLines() {
  return (
    <>
      <defs>
        <pattern id="gridLine">
          <line x1="1" y1="0" x2="1" y2="1"><line>
        </pattern>
      </defs>
      <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="url(#gridLine)" />
    </>
  );
}
```

The paterns' parent `<GridPatternWrapper>` is an SVG element that's absolutely positioned and filling whatever relatively-positioned container it's in.

```js
const GridPatternWrapper = styled.svg`
  position: absolute;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  stroke: var(--grid-line-stroke-color); // stroke color of the line
  fill: var(--grid-line-stroke-color); // fill color of the dots
`;
```

## Layering on visual effects

In addition to the gridlines, [Emil's landing page](https://vaul.emilkowal.ski/) also has subtle visual effects that take the design to the next level.
- The grid fades out toward the bottom. 
- There's a subtle glow effect "shining down" on the grid.
- A few of the grid cells are filled in with a solid color.

I recreated these effects in my interactive grid to learn how they were implemented.

### Image Masking

Radial gradient

/* MASK */
  --mask-rgb: 255, 255, 255;
  mask-image: radial-gradient(
    100% var(--mask-coverage) at top center,
    white,
    rgba(var(--mask-rgb), 0.5),
    rgba(var(--mask-rgb), 0.25),
    rgba(var(--mask-rgb), 0.1),
    rgba(var(--mask-rgb), 0.05),
    transparent
  );
