Let's talk about the good things. 

## Green card
In January, after two years (!) of waiting, my green card was approved. In February it was mailed out and in March it was finally in my hands. I let the process take up way too much of my mental space for far too long. I'm so glad to have it and have this chapter behind me. 

## Code
I picked up more code skills and coded more than ever before. Off the top of my head...

Technologies learned:
- Next Pages Router
- React useState, useEffect, 
- TypeScript
- Next App Router and React Server Components
- Tailwind
- Framer Motion
- IntersectionObserver API
- Figma Plugins API
- Figma Variables API
- Async Await
- Fetch API


Let me list what I did:
- Switched my site from Gatsby to Next.js
- Used IntersectionObserver to animate on scroll and animate when in view
- Dark mode and theming using CSS variables
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Next App Router and Server Components
- Josh Comeau's React Course
- Prototyped a table of contents
- Wrote a node.js script
- Interactive Grid Pattern
- Wrote Figma plugins to generate Figma variables and draw/populate frames and components on the canvas
- Wrote a script to generate themes

Courses I took and resources I used:
- Josh Comeau's The Joy of React course
- Build UI
- Bytegrad's videos
- Kevin Powell's videos
- 

## Travel
I traveled a lot in 2023. I think only three months didn't have a trip and some months had multiple trips. I also just generally did more things and spent more money on entertainment and food and drinks. I think 2023 was the first year post-pandemic where things felt fully open and free of restrictions or fear. 

- Mexico City
- Rio
- Fire Island
- Sicily
- Paris
- San Francisco
- Miami 4x
- Hometown 2x

## The Brass Factory
One of my goals for 2023 was to spend less time in my apartment. Actually I was committed to getting out of my apartment as much as possible. 

To that end, I rented a desk at a co-working space. Lots of light. Lots of plants. It was so worth it for my mental health. 

## Design Systems and Design Engineering
- Figma Variables
- Theming

Now, something that wasn't so great...

## Layoffs and bad vibes in tech
In January many people I worked with were let go, and for the first time ever, I had to personally deliver the news. It sucked. And it really set the tone for the next few months and if I'm being honest for the rest of the year. 

It's been a weird year in tech. It feels like a big balloon popped in 2022 and has been continually deflating all year. Vibes are off. I still sense fear and malaise in the air, and it's hard to shake the feeling things just aren't as good as they used to be. 

I'm hoping optimism and excitement will return in 2024.
