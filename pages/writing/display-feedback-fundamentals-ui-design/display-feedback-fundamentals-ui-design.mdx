  <BlogPostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogPostLayout>
);
import Link from "next/link";

If the UI has changed state or if it’s in the process of changing state, then the user needs to know about it — especially when the change was triggered by an action the user took.  

Feedback reduces uncertainty and frustration for the user, and preserves their confidence in the UI.  

A UI needs to show feedback for the following states:

**Success** when a change in state was successful. This doesn’t always have to be a green checkmark and a success message. It can be as subtle as changing a label from “on” to “off,” for example. 

**Error** when a change in state failed or an input was invalid.

**Progress** when quantity or position has incremented. 

**Loading** when the UI is between states, waiting for data to load. 

**Empty** when there is no data to show. This makes it clear there is no data rather than a bug or connection error. 

**Connection Status** if data isn’t syncing.

**Interactivity** Hover, Pressed, Focused, Disabled states on interactive elements like buttons, links, inputs, and controls.
