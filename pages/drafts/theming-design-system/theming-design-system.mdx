Color is the most important — and as you'll see, complex — part of theming. 

### Colors Differentiate Brands
Themes let you support multiple brand identities with the same set of UI components, and color is one of the main things that visually differentiates one brand from another. 
 
[Color as a brand differentiator. Brand A, B, C]

But colors do more than differntiate one brand from another.

### Colors Have Functional Jobs
Colors also have funcitonal jobs to do in the interface. They help guide someone's attention to make it easier for them to do what they came to do. This is done in two ways:
1. Creating hierarchy 
2. Communicating meaning

Color is one of the most important tools we have to guide someone's attention. This is done in two main ways:
1. Hierarchy 
2. Meaning



- A theme can change many visual properties, but without a change in color, it would be hard to tell that a theme has changed. 
- Themes are usually created to support multiple brand identities with the same set of UI components, and color is one of the main things that visually differentiates one brand from another. 

- But colors do more than communicate a brand identity. 

- Colors have funcitonal jobs to do in the interface.

Colors are there for a reason. They have jobs to do.
- Create the contrast needed to create hierarchy in the interface.
- Create the contrast needed to make text readable and accessible.  
- Give feedback to users by communicating interactivity and state. (e.g. hover, focus, active, success, error, warning, etc.)
  - Affordance, signifiers, semantic meaning
- Support user preferences like mode of the interface. (e.g. light, dark, etc.)
- Ensure accessibility by meeting contrast requirements. (e.g. WCAG AA, WCAG AAA, etc.)


Given these various jobs, it's important to have a color palette that supports these jobs.

A color is a hue and shade. 
Hue is the color itself.
Shade is the lightness or darkness of the color.



- A range of shades and hues is needed to support an interface. 
  - Different elements need different colors. (Text, Background, Border, Icon, Shadow, etc.)  
  - Different levels of contrast are needed to support different levels of hierarchy.
  - Different colors are needed to support different states. (e.g. hover, focus, active, disabled, etc.)
  - Different colors are needed to support different modes. (e.g. light, dark, brand A, brand B, etc.)
