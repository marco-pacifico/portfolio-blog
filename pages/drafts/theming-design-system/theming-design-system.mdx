I can't talk about theming without talking about color. Color is the most obvious part of a theme. It's also the most complex. 

[Theme one, theme 2]

Why is color a complex topic? Two reasons.

## Places

## Roles

Multiply these out. Lots of colors.

## Color Scales
Contrast = difference between lightness. Every color has a job. 


Why is that? A couple reason. First color is applied to every single element in an interface, from text, to backgrounds, to fills, to icons. 

That's because color is applied to every element in an interface. 

[background, border, icon, text]

Then multiply that by the fact that each element has function to perform, and so colors are needed to support that function.  

For example, a single button might have five different colors. 

[background, border, icon, hover, pressed, disabled]



 
As you'll see, there's more to it than picking a hue or two that represent your brand.  

That's because colors serve many purposes (brand and functional) and because every single element in an interface has at least one color applied to it. 

That's becasue in addition to branding and visual identity, colors have many functional jobs to perform. And every single element in an interface has a color applied to it. 



### Colors Differentiate Brands
Theming lets you support multiple brand identities with the same set of UI components, and color is one of the main things that visually differentiates one brand from another. 
 
[Color as a brand differentiator. Brand A, B, C]

But colors do more than differntiate one brand from another.

That's because color is used in every part of the interface -- backgrounds, borders, text, icons -- and because there are many fucntional roles colors serve.  
[places = backgrounds, borders]

### Visual Identiy 

### Fucntional Jobs 
Colors also have funcitonal jobs to do in the interface. They help guide someone's attention to make it easier for them to do what they came to do. This is done in two ways:
1. Creating hierarchy 
2. Communicating meaning

Color is one of the most important tools we have to guide someone's attention. This is done in two main ways:
1. Hierarchy 
2. Meaning

The theme needs to support these jobs as well as the brand identities.

### Color Scale

- A theme can change many visual properties, but without a change in color, it would be hard to tell that a theme has changed. 
- Themes are usually created to support multiple brand identities with the same set of UI components, and color is one of the main things that visually differentiates one brand from another. 

- But colors do more than communicate a brand identity. 

- Colors have funcitonal jobs to do in the interface.

Colors are there for a reason. They have jobs to do.
- Create the contrast needed to create hierarchy in the interface.
- Create the contrast needed to make text readable and accessible.  
- Give feedback to users by communicating interactivity and state. (e.g. hover, focus, active, success, error, warning, etc.)
  - Affordance, signifiers, semantic meaning
- Support user preferences like mode of the interface. (e.g. light, dark, etc.)
- Ensure accessibility by meeting contrast requirements. (e.g. WCAG AA, WCAG AAA, etc.)


Given these various jobs, it's important to have a color palette that supports these jobs.

A color is a hue and shade. 
Hue is the color itself.
Shade is the lightness or darkness of the color.



- A range of shades and hues is needed to support an interface. 
  - Different elements need different colors. (Text, Background, Border, Icon, Shadow, etc.)  
  - Different levels of contrast are needed to support different levels of hierarchy.
  - Different colors are needed to support different states. (e.g. hover, focus, active, disabled, etc.)
  - Different colors are needed to support different modes. (e.g. light, dark, brand A, brand B, etc.)
