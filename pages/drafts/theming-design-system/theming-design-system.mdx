import BlogPostLayout from "../../../components/layouts/BlogPostLayout";
export default ({ children }) => (
  <BlogPostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogPostLayout>
);

Theming means that the same component library can be used to build multiple products, and each product can have completely different look and feel. 

- One component library
- Supports multiple products
- Each product has a different look and feel

## Benefits

### One source of truth means less code to maintain
Any bug fixes or improvements made to a component only need to be made in once place for all products to benefit from the change.

### Consistent user experience
The structure and behavior of individual components will be the same across products. For example, tooltips will work the same way in all products. Keyboard navigation on modals will work the same way. 

Even the typographical scale will be the same across products.That means all products will benefit from the hierarchy and accessibility of the components.

### Scalable 
The marginal cost of adding a new theme is essentially zero, you can add an arbitrary number of themes without increasing the complexity of the system.

Styling is systematic and parameterized rather than one off and ad hoc
Styling changes have to be made in one place -- the theme -- and from a constrained set of options. 

## Downsides of theming

### Upfront work to get right
- Theming is hard to do well
- Upfront work to get right
- Involves naming things you wouldn't otherwise have to name. For example, if you have a component that has a background color, you have to name the background color. If you have a component that has a border, you have to name the border.

### Potential for a one size fits none problem as needs diverge
If the needs of the products diverge, you're faced with either adding additional props to the components to support the different use cases, or adding more components to support the different use cases. Meanign all the products have to be weighed down with the additional complexity.

API of each component grows as you add more props to support different use cases. Products weighed down with additional complexity.

Users of the system have to learn how to use the system. They have to learn how to use the components, and they have to learn how to use the theme.

### Customization is limited
If you want to customize the look and feel of a component, you have to do it within the constraints of the theme. For example, if you want to change the color of a button, you have to choose from the colors defined in the theme.

Things like icons and illustrations are hard to theme. You can't just change the color of an icon, you have to change the icon itself.

### Potential for breaking changes
Anothe downside of single source of truth
Breaking changes to the theme can have a ripple effect across all products. For example, if you change the color of a button, you have to change the color of all the buttons in all the products.

Let's say you have a set of UI components you've been using to make a website. 

[Show example of a website with components]

Then at some point you need to make a second website that has the same functionality, but it's for a different product that's branded differently.

So, instead of blue buttons you need purple buttons. Instead of a white background you need a black background. And instead of a sans serif font you need a serif font. 

One way to do make the second website would be to duplicate the code from the first website and update the styles one at at time.

The problem with this is that now you have two sets of code to maintain. If you find a bug in one component, you have to fix it in both places. If you want to add a new component, you'd have to add it in both places.

So another way to do this would be to add a prop to each component that lets you change some of the styles. For example, you could have a color prop on the button.  purple button vs blue button.

And while this might be manageable for two websites, what if you need to support 10 websites? Or 100 websites? Or 1000 websites?

This is where theming comes in. **Theming lets you change the look and feel of the components without changing the components themselves.**


Design tokens and json files
Another way to do this would be to create a theme. A theme is a set of properties that define the look and feel of a product. Themes are used to customize the appearance of the UI components in a product. Themes are defined in a JSON file that contains key-value pairs for the properties that define the theme.
