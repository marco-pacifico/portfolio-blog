What exactly is a theme? What does it consist of? 

Theming comes down to styling UI components with semantically named variables rather than hard coded values, so that when you switch themes, you only have to change the values of the variables, and not the code itself.

Property | Semantic Name | Value Theme A | Value Theme B
---------|---------------|--------------|--------------
background-color | color-bg-brand | #ff0000 | #0000ff
color | color-text-brand | #ffffff | #000000
border-color | color-border-brand | #000000 | #ffffff

What you need for that to work in practice is the following:
1. A list of styles or properties you want to change from one theme to the next
2. Semantically named varialbes representing the value of each property identified in step 1
3. A way of defining the values of the semantic variables for each theme
4. A way of applying the theme to your UI

## List of Properties to Style
The naive approach would be to start by listing every style or property on every UI element. 

```css
.button-primary {
  /* Property 1 */ background-color: #000; 
  /* 2 */ color: #fff; 
  /* 3 */ border-color: #000; 
  /* 4 */ border-radius: 4px;
  /* 5 */ box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);

  &:hover {
    /* 6 */ background-color: #eee; 
  }
}
.button-secondary {
  /* 7 */ background-color: #eee; 
  /* 8 */ color: #fff; 
  ...
}
.heading-1 {
  /* 9 */ color: #000; 
  ...
}

```

But this isn't very practical or scalable, since the number of properties grows with the number elements in your UI. As soon as you add a new element, you have to add all its properties to your theme.

Remember that you'll have to come up with names for each of these properties. You want your list to be short and finite, so that you can remember them and so that you can easily define the values of the semantic variables for each theme.


### Generalize properties into common types or categories
Instead of listing every property on every element, a more practical approach is to generalize the properties into common types or categories that are used in most elements. 

For example, the `color` property is used on almost all eleemnts to style the text color. So you can factor it out into a common type of property called `text`. 

```css
.button-primary {
  /* 1 - text */ color: #fff; 

.button-secondary {
  /* 1 - text */ color: #fff; 
  ...
}
.heading-1 {
  /* 1 - text */ color: #000; 
  ...
}
```

A more practical approach is to think about the different parts of each element that you want to style.
Eg. text, borders, backgrounds, icons, etc.


Take stock of ui elemnts and think about the various parts of each element that you want to style.
Eg. 
by type 
text
borders
backgrounds
icons

by ui components
buttons
inputs


## Semantically Named Variables

You'll might notice that the value of the text property isn't the same for every element. The text color of a button is different from the text color of a heading. So you'll need a way to distinguish between the two.

The way to do that is to come up with a name for each property that has meaning. 

Meaning comes from the `role` the property plays in the UI. 

Name = `type` + `role`

```css

```css

```css
The core of theming is semantic variables or design tokens. All that means is instead of styling a property with a literal value (e.g. background-color: red) you'd come up with a name for that property that has meaning. (e.g. background-color: color-bg-brand)

Coming up with these names is tricky and I'll have an entire post on that. 

Naive way would be to have a unique name for every property on every element. This would work but it would be really difficult to manage and remember. Too many variables, names way too long and specific. 

## Defining the Values of Semantic Variables
`--color-bg-brand: #ff0000;`

Rather than use a literal value, you'd use a semantic name. (e.g. background-color: var(--color-bg-brand))

Data structure that maps semantic names to values.
Figma modes table
json file or js file with object

### Constants vs Variables
You can set raw values (hex codes) but usually you want to choose values from a predefined scale of values. (e.g. color-bg-brand: color-brand-500 that comes from a design system.()
Outside of the scope of theming but related to design systems is that ideally the values you're choosing come from a design system, so that you're not just making up values as you go along. A predefined scale of values that you can choose from, that are all designed to work together, and that were chosen because they serve a specific purpose, usually to do with how they create contrast (for hierarchy and accessibility), how they work together (for harmony and consistency), and the meaning they convey.

### Choosing Values
Can be done one at a time or programmatically based on a few key values. Eg. primary color, secondary color, etc.


## Applying or Switching the Theme

CSS variables are scoped to the element they're defined on. So if you define a variable on the body element, it will be available to all the elements in the body. If you define a variable on a button, it will only be available to that button and its children.

Theme provider component
React context API
creating a theme file that exports an object containing the semantic names and their values. The theme file is then imported into the theme provider component.
The theme provider component will make the theme available to all the components in your application via React's context API.
