import BlogPostLayout from "../../../components/layouts/BlogPostLayout";
export default ({ children }) => (
  <BlogPostLayout meta={meta}>{children}</BlogPostLayout>
);

The key to theming is styling UI components with semantically named variables (e.g. `--color-text`) rather than literal values (e.g. `black`).

That way, when you want to switch themes you don't have to go through the code to replace every instance of a style. Instead, you change the values assigned to these semantically named variables.

## Process
The process for implementing theming can be broken down into five steps:

1. Identify visual properties that will change from one theme to the next. 
2. Define meaningful names for the property values defined in Step 1. I'll call these *semantic variables*.
3. Style UI components with the semantic variables. 
4. Assign values to the semantic variables for each theme.
5. Apply the theme to the UI.

### Example theme structure
<table style={{marginBlock: "var(--space-6)"}}>
    <tr>
        <th style={{textAlign: "left"}}>Property</th>
        <th style={{textAlign: "left"}}>Semantic Variable</th>
        <th style={{textAlign: "left"}}>Value (Theme A)</th>
        <th style={{textAlign: "left"}}>Value (Theme B)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>background-color</td>
        <td>color-bg-brand</td>
        <td>#FF0000</td>
        <td>#0000FF</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>color</td>
        <td>color-text-brand</td>
        <td>#FFFFFF</td>
        <td>#000000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>border-color</td>
        <td>color-border-brand</td>
        <td>#000000</td>
        <td>#FFFFFF</td>
    </tr>
</table>

```css
/* Style UI components with the semantic variables */
.button-primary {
  background-color: var(--color-bg-brand); 
  color: var(--color-text-brand); 
  border-color: var(--color-border-brand); 
}

/* Assign Values to Semantic Variables for Each Theme */
.root {
  [data-theme="theme-a"] {
    --color-bg-brand: #FF0000;
    --color-text-brand: #FFFFFF;
    --color-border-brand: #000000;
  }
  [data-theme="theme-b"] {
    --color-bg-brand: #0000FF;
    --color-text-brand: #000000;
    --color-border-brand: #FFFFFF;
  }
}

/* Apply the theme to the UI */
<button 
  class="button-primary" 
  data-theme="theme-a">
  Click Me
</button>
```

<span style={{fontWeight: 600}}>Step 1</span>
## Identify Visual Properties
You could go through every UI element and identify all the properties that could change from one theme to the next, with the intention of giving each style a unique name.

```css
.button-primary {
  /* Property 1 */ background-color: #000; 
  /* 2 */ color: #fff; 
  /* 3 */ border-color: #000; 
  /* 4 */ border-radius: 4px;
  /* 5 */ box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);

  &:hover {
    /* 6 */ background-color: #eee; 
  }
}
.button-secondary {
  /* 7 */ background-color: #eee; 
  /* 8 */ color: #fff; 
  ...
}
.heading-1 {
  /* 9 */ color: #000; 
  ...
}
```

But this approach isn't very practical or scalable because the number of properties would grow with the number elements in an application. As soon as you add a new element, you'd have to add all its properties to the theme.

You want the list of properties to be short and finite, so you can name them and remember them. That way it won't be too complicated and tedius to work with and configure a theme.

### Generalize and factor out common visual properties
Instead of listing every property on every element, a more practical approach is to factor out properties into common types or categories that are used in most elements. 

Zoom out and think about styling more generally. What types of visual changes are possible?

You can change font or typography.
You can change spacing.
You can change colors on text, backgrounds, borders, and svgs/icons.
You can change shadows is it elevated or flat.
You can change border styles. Both thickness and radius. 

So this is most geneneral things you can change, so you can start there.

Then you can think about where. Again, deconstruct and generalize the ui. A button for example has text, a background, a border, and an icon. So you can start there.

Finally you can get into why you're changing these properties. What is the purpose of changing them? What is the role they play in the ui?

One is creating contrast to create hierarchy and draw attention. The other might be to provide feedback on interactivity. The other might be to convey meaning. Meaning could be semantic (e.g. success, warning, error) or it could be to convey a mood or feeling (e.g. dark mode, light mode, etc. or it could be to convey a brand (e.g. primary color, secondary color, etc.

Then you can go one level deeper and think about where these properties are applied. For someo of them, it's obvious, like typography is applied to text. For things like color, though, you have to specific where it's applied.

The other thing to consider is the role of the property. What is it used for? What does it do? What does it mean?

Role = hierarchy (level of contrast), 

Then fur

For some of these, like color, you might need to specific where it's applied. 

Kind = Color, Font, Space, Shadow, Radius, Border 
One level deepr is where it's applied = Text, Background, Border, Icon. Again these are the most generalized parts of a ui. 

So you could have a `color-text` property, a `color-bg` property, a `color-border` property, and a `color-icon` property. 

For example, the `color` property is used on almost all elemnts to style the text color. So you can factor it out into a common type of property called `color-text`. 

Since the text color of a button is different from the text color of a heading, you'll need a way to distinguish between the two. The way to do that is to come up with a name for each property that has meaning. 

That's where role comes in.

```css

```css
.button-primary {
  /* 1 - text */ color: #fff; 
}
.button-secondary {
  /* 1 - text */ color: #fff; 
  ...
}
.heading-1 {
  /* 1 - text */ color: #000; 
  ...
}
```

In addition to `text`, common types of properties include `background`, `border`, `shadow`, and `radius`.


A more practical approach is to think about the different parts of each element that you want to style.
Eg. text, borders, backgrounds, icons, etc.


Take stock of ui elemnts and think about the various parts of each element that you want to style.
Eg. 
by type 
text
borders
backgrounds
icons

by ui components
buttons
inputs


## Define Semantic Variables

You'll might notice that the value of the text property isn't the same for every element. The text color of a button is different from the text color of a heading. So you'll need a way to distinguish between the two.

The way to do that is to come up with a name for each property that has meaning. 

Meaning comes from the `role` the property plays in the UI. 

Name = `type` + `role`

The core of theming is semantic variables or design tokens. All that means is instead of styling a property with a literal value (e.g. background-color: red) you'd come up with a name for that property that has meaning. (e.g. background-color: color-bg-brand)

Coming up with these names is tricky and I'll have an entire post on that. 

Naive way would be to have a unique name for every property on every element. This would work but it would be really difficult to manage and remember. Too many variables, names way too long and specific. 

## Assign Values to Semantic Variables
`--color-bg-brand: #ff0000;`

Rather than use a literal value, you'd use a semantic name. (e.g. background-color: var(--color-bg-brand))

Data structure that maps semantic names to values.
Figma modes table
json file or js file with object

### Constants vs Variables
You can set raw values (hex codes) but usually you want to choose values from a predefined scale of values. (e.g. color-bg-brand: color-brand-500 that comes from a design system.()
Outside of the scope of theming but related to design systems is that ideally the values you're choosing come from a design system, so that you're not just making up values as you go along. A predefined scale of values that you can choose from, that are all designed to work together, and that were chosen because they serve a specific purpose, usually to do with how they create contrast (for hierarchy and accessibility), how they work together (for harmony and consistency), and the meaning they convey.

### Choosing Values
Can be done one at a time or programmatically based on a few key values. Eg. primary color, secondary color, etc.


## Apply the Theme

CSS variables are scoped to the element they're defined on. So if you define a variable on the body element, it will be available to all the elements in the body. If you define a variable on a button, it will only be available to that button and its children.

Theme provider component
React context API
creating a theme file that exports an object containing the semantic names and their values. The theme file is then imported into the theme provider component.
The theme provider component will make the theme available to all the components in your application via React's context API.
