Color is the most noticeable part of a theme. It's also the most complex. In this post I want to do a deep dive on color by exploring the following topics:
- Why do we even need color? What jobs does it perform in a interface?
- How are palettes and color ramps used to support these jobs?
- How do these jobs map to semantic variables?

## Colors Perform Many Jobs
Colors serve both emotional and functional purposes in an interface. They convey meaning and help guide a person's attention. From these two high level jobs, a variety of other jobs emerge at more granular levels of detail. And it's this variety of jobs that makes color the most complex part of a theme. 

## Every Color Variable Represents a Job
Most of the variables in a theme are colors. So it's useful to look at each part of the naming convention for semantic variables to see how color fits in.

### Where color is used
Color can be applied to every part of a UI element. It's background, text, borders, icons, and shadows.
### Why color is used
Different hues are used for different purposes, usually to communicate some type of meaning:
- Brand identity
- Semantic meaning (e.g. success, warning, error, etc.) 
- Differentiate between types of content (e.g. statuses, categories, promotional vs. informational, etc.)
- And also to support user preferences, like with light and dark mode. 

### To what degree (how much) color is used
If each hue represents the "why" of color, then each shade of that hue represents the "how much" of color. Different shades are used to vary contrast in an interface, which creates hierarchy: And hierarchy is does the following:
- Guides attention to parts of the interface that are more important than others
- Maks text and other elements legible and accessible
- Signifies interactivity and changes in state (e.g. hover, focus, active)

It's because of all these jobs (the permutations across where, why, and how much) that color will produce the most semantic variables, and therefore represents the most complex part of theming.

## Hues = Meaning = Palettes
Each hue in a color palette is chosen for a specific reason. It's there to communicate some type of meaning. 
- What's in a palette and why is it there
- brand colors
 - primary and supporting accent colors 
- semantic colors (info, success, warning, error, etc..)
- neutral (grays)
  - pairs well with brand color
- Hues support different roles in the UI
- Communicate feedback (warning, error, etc..)
- Differentiate and categorize content (e.g. badges, and labels) 
- Support user preferences (light vs. dark mode)

- All need to work well together 

## Shades = Contrast = Color Scales
- Each hue chosen in the color palette has its own scale
- Every scale-value has a job its best suited for
- Let's imagine a UI in grayscale, devoid of any color saturation at all. 
- Reason to have a scale is to support contrast needed to create hierarchy in the UI

Fucntional purpose of any visual treatment in an interface is to guide attention in a way that facilitates the completion of a task or flow in the product. Color is one important tool for doing this.

Contrast needed to create hierarchy and guide attention.
- Text
- Surfaces and Background
- Borders
- Icons
- Interactive Elements

- Contrast needed for accessibility (legibility of text)
- Contrast needed to communicate interactive states: Active, Hover, Focus,
- Color scale needed to support these functional job

```css
.blackA {
  --black-a1: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);
  --black-a2: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  --black-a3: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
  --black-a4: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  --black-a5: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  --black-a6: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  --black-a7: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
  --black-a8: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
  --black-a9: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  --black-a10: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
  --black-a11: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);
  --black-a12: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.95);
}
```
```css
.sky {
  --sky-1: #f9feff;
  --sky-2: #f1fafd;
  --sky-3: #e1f6fd;
  --sky-4: #d1f0fa;
  --sky-5: #bee7f5;
  --sky-6: #a9daed;
  --sky-7: #8dcae3;
  --sky-8: #60b3d7;
  --sky-9: #7ce2fe;
  --sky-10: #74daf8;
  --sky-11: #00749e;
  --sky-12: #1d3e56;
}
.skyA {
  --sky-a1: #00d5ff06;
  --sky-a2: #00a4db0e;
  --sky-a3: #00b3ee1e;
  --sky-a4: #00ace42e;
  --sky-a5: #00a1d841;
  --sky-a6: #0092ca56;
  --sky-a7: #0089c172;
  --sky-a8: #0085bf9f;
  --sky-a9: #00c7fe83;
  --sky-a10: #00bcf38b;
  --sky-a11: #00749e;
  --sky-a12: #002540e2;
}
```

## Color Contrast and Accessibility
- Combine scale values that meet WCAG AA and AAA contrast ratios
- Background and Foreground/Text combination


## Mapping Colors to UI Elements via Semantic Variables
- List of semantic Variables
- Used to style ui Elements
- Name implies what, where, and why it's used
- Map that to color scale values that perform that job the best
- e.g. `--color-text-info` maps to `--sky-11` (dark blue)


## Steps
- Choose a primary brand color (hue and scale value)
- Choose an onbrand color (e.g. button text)
- Choose a neutral hue
- Choose semantic hueus 
- Optional: Choose accent brand color and onbrand color (used in other sections)
- Inverse? 

## Neutral Scale
- 50
- 100
- 200
- 300
...

## Why Color is Complex
Most of the semantic variables in a theme are color variables. Why is that? Looking back at the naming convention for semantic variables, color is the only type of property that picks up a modifier from every column.

Color is also the only type of visual property that can be broken down into two parts: hue and shade. Where hue is the color itself, and shade is the amount of lightness or darkness of that color.

Because of all these permutations, color will produce the most semantic variables, and therefore represents the most complex part of theming.

Because colors perform many jobs, they represent the most complex part of a theme and make up the majority of the semantic variables in a theme. 

It's the number of jobs that make color the most complex part of a theme and their why color makes up the majority of the semantic variables in a theme. 

## The Jobs Colors Perform in a UI
Brand
- visual identity and brand differentiation

Functional
- Functional jobs, related to:
  - Contrast 
  - Meaning

Colors also have funcitonal jobs to do in the interface. They help guide someone's attention to make it easier for them to do what they came to do. This is done in two ways:

1. Creating hierarchy

2. Communicating meaning


Color is one of the most important tools we have to guide someone's attention. This is done in two main ways:

1. Hierarchy

2. Meaning

The theme needs to support these jobs as well as the brand identities.

Colors are there for a reason. They have jobs to do.

- Create the contrast needed to create hierarchy in the interface.

- Create the contrast needed to make text readable and accessible.

- Give feedback to users by communicating interactivity and state. (e.g. hover, focus, active, success, error, warning, etc.)

 - Affordance, signifiers, semantic meaning

- Support user preferences like mode of the interface. (e.g. light, dark, etc.)

- Ensure accessibility by meeting contrast requirements. (e.g. WCAG AA, WCAG AAA, etc.)


Given these various jobs, it's important to have a color palette that supports these jobs.
